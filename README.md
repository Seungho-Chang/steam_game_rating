## Analysis Questions

• Is there a significant relationship between game type and game rating?

• Does the release year have a significant impact on the ratings of the game? (New released games are always better than old games?)

• How does each feature (achievements, genre, price) impact the ratings of games?

• What type of games are receiving the most attention right now? (Filtering by 24-Hour Peak & compare with game rating)
